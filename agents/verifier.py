    (Placeholder) The entry point for the Verification agent.

    This agent is intended to perform a "second pass" check on the evidence
    provided by the Screener and Extractor agents. This acts as a control
    against LLM hallucination and can increase confidence in the results,
    especially for low-confidence or "Unsure" cases.

    A full implementation would involve:
    - Identifying low-confidence extractions or "Unsure" screening decisions.
    - Crafting a new, targeted prompt for each case. For example:
      "Does the following quote: '[quote]' support the claim that the
      sample size is [value]?"
    - Calling the LLM with this new prompt.
    - Potentially updating the original result or flagging it for manual review.

    For now, this is a placeholder and simply passes the state through.
